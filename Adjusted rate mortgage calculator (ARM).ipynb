    "\n",
    "An adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of mortgage in which the interest rate on the loan adjusts periodically over the life of the loan based on changes in a benchmark interest rate. This means that the monthly payments on the loan can go up or down over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate on an ARM is typically fixed for a certain number of years at the beginning of the loan, after which it adjusts periodically based on the benchmark rate. The benchmark rate is often a financial index, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the yield on U.S. Treasury securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of Python code that calculates the monthly payments on an ARM with a fixed interest rate for the first 5 years, after which the interest rate adjusts annually based on the LIBOR rate:"
